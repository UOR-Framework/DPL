This is the Universal Object Reference (UOR) Declarative Programming Language (DPL) Specification. The UOR-DPL is under initial development and is currently being defined. 

UOR-DPL is a programming framework that allows developers to define and manage data, along with the rules and relationships governing that data, in a highly organized and intuitive manner. It combines aspects of data storage, data manipulation, and system orchestration into a unified approach. This means that UOR-DPL enables not just storing and retrieving data, but also dictating how different parts of a system interact with each other based on that data.

UOR-DPL adopts a declarative programming model, emphasizing the description of what the program should achieve rather than detailing the control flow to achieve it. This approach is akin to SQL in databases or HTML in web development, focusing on the end goal rather than the step-by-step procedure.

It integrates concepts from data modeling (similar to Entity-Relationship models in databases) and orchestration (like that seen in Kubernetes or Terraform) to manage complex data relationships and operational workflows.

UOR-DPL utilizes semantic data structures (akin to RDF in Semantic Web) for representing and interlinking data, allowing for meaningful and context-aware data management.

The language is designed to be both extensible and scalable, suitable for various applications ranging from cloud computing and microservices to complex enterprise data systems.

Emphasizing a single API for all data interactions, UOR-DPL aligns with modern trends in API-driven development and microservices architecture, providing a single source of truth for all system interactions.

In essence, UOR-DPL represents a convergence of several key aspects of modern computing - declarative programming, data modeling, orchestration, and semantic data processing - into a unified and highly effective programming language and framework.
