A [UOR Class](./core/built-in/class.json) is a type that represents a data structure and is used to link methods that can be used to manipulate that data structure.

A UOR Class contains a schema definition that describes the data structure of the Class. Methods are linked to a UOR Class by using the UOR Statement to link UOR Runtime definitions to the UOR Class.
