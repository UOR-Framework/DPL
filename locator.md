This is the Locator Specification of the Universal Object Reference (UOR) Declarative Programming Language (DPL).

The Locator Specification describes how a pointer in UOR-DPL is accessed and manipulated.

All Locators are described using the UOR Runtime schema. All Locators MUST implement the UOR Locator Interface. The UOR Locator Interface is defined by this specification and can be extended by Locators to enable additional functionality. Locators that extend the UOR Locator Interface may publish additional UOR Runtime formatted methods that are not defined by this specification.

The Locator Interface is defined by the following methods:

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete
