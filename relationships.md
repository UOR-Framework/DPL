The [Relationship Schema](./core/built-in/relationships.json) is a built-in schema used to describe the possible relationships between UOR built-in schemas. This schema can be used to describe the relationships between non-built-in schemas as well. The current version of the UOR Relationship schema is an approximation of what is needed, but needs to be refined and developed further. 

Additional relationships can be defined by publishing UOR Classes the describe relationships. Relationship Classes are defined in the same way that other UOR Classes are defined.
